![Ui.png](Ui.png)

MegaTron Griffin ToDo Bot is a command-line application that helps you manage your tasks.  
Megatron Griffin is a chatbot inspired by Meg Griffin from the show "Family Guy". Megatron Griffin is designed to help you stay up-to-date with tasks, while having a sarcastic and insecure tone.
You can store tasks categorized into **todos**, **deadlines**, and **events**, and perform actions such as add, mark, unmark, delete, find, and list.
